# Autostart Applications
#
# This directory contains .desktop files for applications that should
# start automatically when logging into GNOME.
#
# To add an autostart application, create a .desktop file here.
# Example:
#
# [Desktop Entry]
# Type=Application
# Name=My App
# Exec=/path/to/myapp
# X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
# Hidden=false
#
# Or copy from /usr/share/applications/ and modify as needed.
